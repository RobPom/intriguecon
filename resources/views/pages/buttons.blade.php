  <h1>IntrigueCon: A History in Buttons</h3>
  
  <p>Over the years IntrigueCon has awarded a series of buttons recognising various contributions and milesstones. Wandering around the con you might see some whose appearance gives little away about their meaning. Hopefully the following list will help to decipher the meaning of some of these as well as shedding some light on the history of IntrigueCon.</p>

The reason for this is we put the first con together very quickly just as a proof of concept. The first con was actually called IntrigueCon 0.1.</p><p>Held in the Brookside Community League Hall, The official IntrigueCon 1 had 40 attendees.</div>"><img src="/img/btns/2014_attend_s.png"/></a>&nbsp;

We consider 2014 our first proper year of the con hence the “2”.</p><p>2015 saw a return to the newly renovated Lansdowne Community League Hall with 47 atendees.</div>"><img src="/img/btns/2015_attend_s.png"/></a>&nbsp;

So to recognise attendees that signed up and played, or ran, a game in every session over the weekend we awarded them the “full xp bar” button. We didn’t keep track of exactly how many of these were issued, but a surprising number of attendees come out for the whole shooting match and the four sections of the bar represent the four sessions.

				data-html="true" data-placement="auto" data-content="<div><p>One of the fixtures of IntrigueCon is Sſtabmontown, a brutal, but fun, Old School Dungeons & Dragons game run by Adam Waldron-Blaine. At some point every IConner worth their salt should play it. When you do you get the #Sſtabz button to show you’ve had your mettle tested and met the challenge!</p>

				<p>Fun fact! There was actually an IntrigueCon 0.5 which consisted of about ten of us getting together in April 2014, playing Sſtabmontown, and making plans for the event that would become IntrigueCon 1 that October..
