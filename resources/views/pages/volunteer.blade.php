            <p>It's great you're considering volunteering to help and/or run some games. 
            We're loving the enthusiasm and intensity and we're now ready to harness your awesomeness!</p>

            <h2>Game Masters</h2>
            <p>We have a theme this year so if you'd like a little constraint (and it is completely optional) 
            this year's theme is... "Glory is fleeting, obscurity lasts forever"</p>
 
        Anyway, be sure to register first and then fill out an email just like the one below. It'd be really really helpful if you'd try and copy the formatting of the sample provided.
 
        Thanks! You're a champ!
